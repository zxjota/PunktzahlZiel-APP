  <h1>Privacy Policy for PunktzahlZiel</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: November 12, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for choosing <strong>PunktzahlZiel</strong> (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "the App", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application and related services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and to being transparent about our data practices.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope of this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect: (a) directly through the PunktzahlZiel mobile application; (b) when you interact with our customer support or contact us via email; and (c) through any associated websites, in-app messages, or online services that link to this policy. It does not apply to information collected by third parties (including through advertisements or other apps) unless explicitly stated.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information that helps us deliver, maintain, and improve the App. The categories below describe the types of data we collect and examples of each.</p>

  <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
  <p>
    Personal Information means data that can reasonably identify you individually. We may collect:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> email address (for example, if you contact us or sign up for newsletters).</li>
    <li><strong>User-provided profile data:</strong> optional display name, avatar, or other profile details you choose to provide.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Non-Identifying and Technical Information</h3>
  <p>
    We also collect information that does not directly identify you but helps us operate the App and analyze usage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> device model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, and device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> information about how you use the App, including feature usage, session duration, screens viewed, and interaction events.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash and Diagnostic Data:</strong> logs, error reports, and performance data to help us troubleshoot and improve the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> aggregated or pseudonymized analytics collected via third-party analytics providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Location Information</h3>
  <p>
    The App may collect approximate location information derived from your device’s IP address or network information. We will only collect precise geolocation if you explicitly enable a feature that requires it and grant the App permission to access your location.
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Information from Third Parties</h3>
  <p>
    When you link or sign in with third-party services (for example, social sign-in providers), we may receive basic profile information from those services to facilitate your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Collect Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directly from you:</strong> when you register, contact us, or enter information in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatically:</strong> via cookies, SDKs, and similar technologies that collect technical and usage data.</li>
    <li><strong>From third-party providers:</strong> like analytics or authentication services when you use those integrations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To provide and operate the App:</strong> enabling basic functionality, delivering features, and maintaining app performance.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve the App:</strong> analyzing usage patterns, testing features, fixing bugs, and making product decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>To communicate with you:</strong> responding to support requests, sending important notices (including security and administrative messages), and, if you opt in, marketing communications.</li>
    <li><strong>To protect rights and safety:</strong> preventing fraud, abuse, and security incidents and enforcing our Terms of Service.</li>
    <li><strong>For legal compliance:</strong> complying with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing (Where Applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in a jurisdiction that requires us to state the legal basis for processing your personal data (such as the EU’s GDPR), our legal bases include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> processing necessary to provide the App and its features to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> for analytics, improving services, and protecting against fraud, balanced against your privacy rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where we ask for your permission (for example, to receive marketing emails or precise location information).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> when required to comply with law enforcement requests or legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> with vendors and third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, hosting, customer support). These providers are contractually required to protect your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety and the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, the data collected by the App may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We will require that any buyer agree to respect the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate or de-identified information:</strong> we may share non-identifiable or aggregated data for research, analytics, or advertising purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include links to third-party websites, services, or advertisements. Those third parties may collect information about you independent of PunktzahlZiel. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties; please review their privacy policies before providing personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    We and our service providers use cookies, local storage, mobile identifiers, and similar technologies to collect usage information, remember preferences, and enable certain features. Most devices let you refuse or delete cookies via browser or device settings, but disabling these technologies may affect app functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party analytics tools to understand how the App is used and to measure performance. These tools collect information such as usage events, device information, and IP addresses. Some analytics providers may use cookies or mobile identifiers to collect data across apps and websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not use your personal information for targeted advertising unless you opt in and we clearly disclose such processing.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When data is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect the personal information we process. These measures aim to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data. However, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    PunktzahlZiel is operated from the United States and the personal information we collect may be stored and processed in the U.S. or any other country where we or our service providers operate. If you are located outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to, and processed in, the United States. We will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for cross-border transfers where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information. For residents of certain jurisdictions, the age threshold may be higher (for example, 16 in some regions); in those cases we follow applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>14. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of personal information where we are not required to retain it by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction or objection:</strong> ask us to limit or stop certain processing activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> receive a machine-readable copy of the personal information you provided to the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> opt out of marketing communications and, where applicable, sale or sharing of personal information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email address provided below. We may ask you to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests. We will respond to valid requests in accordance with applicable law.
  </p>

  </ul>

  <h2>16. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or improvements to the App. When we make material changes, we will provide notice via the App, email (if available), or by posting a prominent notice on our website or within the App. The "Effective date" at the top of this policy indicates when the policy was last updated.
  </p>

  <h2>17. Additional Disclosures for Specific Jurisdictions</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>California Residents:</strong> If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and related regulations, including the right to request information about categories of personal information we have collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose. To exercise your CCPA rights, contact us at the email address above and specify your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>European Residents:</strong> European residents may have rights under applicable data protection laws (for example, GDPR). For European residents, our legal basis for processing personal data is described above. If you are located in the EU/EEA and wish to exercise your rights, please contact us via the email above.
  </p>

  <h2>18. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
  <p>
    Some features of the App may be powered by third-party services. The privacy practices of those third parties are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read those policies to understand how they handle your information.
  </p>

  <h2>19. No Guarantee of Anonymity</h2>
  <p>
    While we may provide options to use our services in a pseudonymous way, we cannot guarantee full anonymity. Certain usage patterns, device identifiers, or other technical information may allow re-identification in limited circumstances.
  </p>

  <h2>20. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
  <p>
    Many browsers and devices offer "Do Not Track" settings. The App does not currently act on Do Not Track signals because there is not yet a uniform standard for how those signals should be interpreted.
